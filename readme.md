Futuristic UI
============

Description :
-----------
The goal of this exercise was to create a futuristic UI.
I was inspired by Marvel's Iron Man and its augmented reality. You are Tony Stark and you enter his supercomputer JARVIS' interface.

Technologies :
--------------
*HTML5
*CSS3
*JavaScript
*Preprocessor: Gulp

Features :
----------
*13 seconds long loading and building animation
*Blinking JARVIS in the center of the screen
*3 floating screens on the sides, each facing your mouse as it moves
*The screens are all linked to a part of the computer in the center
*You can enable/disable the shield by clicking on it on the bottom right of your screen.
*Desktop only (yes it's a feature)
